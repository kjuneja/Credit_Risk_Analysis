# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, you’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, you’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once we’re done, we’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

This project consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report. We will submit the following:

* Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
* Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
* Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
* Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)
